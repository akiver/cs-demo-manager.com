# Announcing CS:DM V3

Hi :wave:, I'm happy to announce that CS Demo Manager V3 is out! :tada:

{/* truncate */}

This version is a complete application rewrite with **new features**, **improvements**, and **CS2 support**.  
It was a long journey - I started to prototype it around 2018 and worked on it on and off during my free time since then.

## Main changes

- **CS2 support** - the application now supports **CS2**. Please note that as of today, there are some
  limitations with CS2 compared to CSGO.
- **Cross-platform** - the application now works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Performance** - it was the main V2 issue, data are now stored in a database instead of JSON files. Retrieving data is now much faster.
- **Demos download** - the application can automatically download your last MM demos and has a dedicated UI.
- **Demo analyzer** - the application now uses a [separate program](https://github.com/akiver/cs-demo-analyzer)
  for demo analysis. You can use it without CS:DM if you want to.
- **New UI** - the old-school lime green UI is replaced with a modern dark/light theme.

There are other changes that you may notice. The V3 _should_ offer the same features as the V2.

## Links

:::warning
The V3 requires a database - you have to install PostgreSQL on your machine to use it.  
Please read the [installation](/docs/installation) guide for instructions.
