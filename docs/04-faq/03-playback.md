## The camera doesn't focus on the player

- On **Linux and CS2 demos** it's [not yet supported](/docs/cs2#demo-playback). You have to focus the camera manually.
- On **Windows and CS2 demos** you have to keep the [CS2 window focused](/docs/cs2#demo-playback).

## CS2 demo playback doesn't start or crashes

1. Steam must be running without admin rights.
2. Close any anticheat software (FaceIt, ESEA, etc.).
3. CS2 updates may break playback for demos generated from previous CS2 versions, leading to playback not starting or the game crashing.  
   To detect if it's a CS2 or CS:DM issue, you should try to play the demo **from the game rather than CS:DM** and check if the playback starts **and** the game doesn't crash during the playback (it can happen).  
   If it doesn't work in the game either, that's probably because the demo was recorded with an older CS2 version and is incompatible with the latest version.  
   Valve sometimes creates a "_branch_" (available from the game properties in Steam) to allow playing on a previous game version.  
   As a last resort, you can try to find a compatible CS2 branch by selecting it from the CS2 properties in Steam and then try to play the demo again.  
   CS:DM starts the currently installed version of CS2 so if it doesn't work in the game, it won't work in CS:DM either.  
   If the issue happens only when playing the demo from CS:DM, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/akiver/cs-demo-manager/issues/new).

## Can I watch CSGO demos?

Yes, please follow this [documentation](/docs/guides/playback#watching-csgo-demos).

## What are VDM/JSON files next to my demo?

[VDM](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Demo_Recording_Tools) and JSON files are generated by CS:DM when starting
the game to control the demo playback (camera focus, fast forward, etc.).

VDM files are used only for CS:GO demos as they are not supported by CS2.  
JSON files mimic VDM files for CS2 and are read by the CS:DM server plugin when playing a CS2 demo.

Those files should be deleted automatically when the game is closed and can also be safely deleted manually.
