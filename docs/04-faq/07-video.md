## I have an error when the game start

Make sure to update HLAE. Game updates may break HLAE compatibility.

## What's the difference between VirtualDub and FFmpeg?

**VirtualDub** generates uncompressed videos, whereas **FFmpeg** generates compressed x264 video (by default).

## Why not use only VirtualDub?

Because VirtualDub is Windows only and doesn't include codecs like x264 by default, you must install it manually, which
is quite annoying.
