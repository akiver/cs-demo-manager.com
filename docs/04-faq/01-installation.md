# Installation

## PSQL binary not found

If you have the error message "**PSQL binary not found**" it means that the PostgreSQL `psql` program is not in your `PATH` environment variable.  
Please follow the [Step 2: Setup psql](/docs/installation#step-2-setup-psql) instructions to fix this issue.

## The app tray icon is missing

On RedHat-based Linux distributions the system tray is not enabled by default.  
You have to install the "Gnome extensions app" and enable it to see the tray icon as mentioned in the [installation instructions](/docs/installation#step-3-the-application?os=linux).
