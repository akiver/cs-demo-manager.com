title: Demos analysis
---

CS Demo Manager extracts data from Counter-Strike **demos** (`.dem` files) and generates **matches**.  
A **match** results from a demo analysis and contains all the information about the game (players, teams, positions, etc.).

## Where to get demos

- From the **Downloads** page in CS:DM. You can download your last 8 Valve Matchmaking or FACEIT demos.
- From the **Watch** page of CS2 client (Matchmaking only).
- From the platform website you are playing on (FACEIT, PopFlash, etc.).
- From [HLTV](https://www.hltv.org) for professional matches.

:::warning
HLTV and some platforms compress demos in archives. You have to decompress it otherwise the application will not _see_ them.
:::

:::warning
Demos links usually expire after around one month.
