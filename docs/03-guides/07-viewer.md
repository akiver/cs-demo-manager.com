## Introduction

CS:DM allows you to watch your demos in 2D.  
It's accessible from the **"2D Viewer"** tab on a match page.

## Audio playback

You can play an audio file along with the demo in the 2D viewer.  
The main purpose of this feature is to listen to teams' communication during the demo playback.

The application automatically loads a possible audio file located next to the demo file.  
For example, if you have a demo named `demo.dem`, the application will look for an audio file named `demo.mp3`, `demo.wav`, etc. next to it.

:::tip
The supported audio formats are `mp3`, `wav`, `flac`, `aac`, `m4a`, and `ogg`, prioritized in that order.
