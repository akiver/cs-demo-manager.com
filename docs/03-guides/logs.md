CS Demo Manager generates log files to help diagnose issues reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/akiver/cs-demo-manager/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).  
There are two types of logs:

- Application — Logs generated by the application.
- Counter-Strike — Logs generated by the internal [Counter-Strike plugin](/docs/development/cs-server-plugin).

:::important
For privacy reasons, the application doesn't send data to an observability service.  
When reporting an issue, please redact any sensitive information from the log files and attach them to the issue. This will help diagnose the problem and save time.
:::

:::tip
You can reveal each log file directly from the application by going to **Settings** > **About** and clicking on one of the **Reveal log file** buttons.
