To support a map the application needs to know some information about it (images, coordinatesâ€¦).  
The application has built-in support for official Counter-Strike maps by default, but you can add your own maps.

## Adding/Editing a map

You can add or edit a map from the settings in the `Maps` tab.

![Maps](/img/documentation/guides/maps/maps_edition.png)

### Name _(mandatory)_

The name of the map is mandatory and must be unique.  
It must match the name of the map in-game.

### Coordinate/scale _(optional)_

The fields `x`, `y`, and `scale` are optional.  
Some features, such as heatmap and 2D replay will work only if they are present.

These values are available in a file called `map_name.txt` where `map_name` is the name of the map.  
Example with the map `de_dust2`, the file `de_dust2.txt` contains:

```
"de_dust2"
{
	"pos_x"		"-2476" // Coordinate X
	"pos_y"		"3239" // Coordinate Y
	"scale"		"4.4" // Scale
}
```

Follow the instructions below to find the files:

3. Reveal the content of the folder `resource/overviews`

:::warning
All official Counter-Strike maps have this file, but custom maps may not have it.

### Thumbnail _(optional)_

The map's thumbnail is an image displayed in some application parts.
It's optional and must be in `PNG` format with a maximum resolution of `600x340`.

### Radars _(optional)_

There are 2 radar images, the upper and lower radars.  
They are used for features such as heatmap and 2D replay and are both optional.  
The lower radar should be filled if the map has 2 levels like `de_nuke`.  
Images must be in `PNG` format, and their resolution must be `1024x1024` pixels.

Follow the instructions below to get the radar images:
