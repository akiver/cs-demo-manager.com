### Demos stats are wrong [#](/docs/analyze#wrong-stats)

Firstly, always check if the demo's source correspond to its origin. You can switch between source from the demos list (right click on the demo).

If the source is correct it could be an analyze bug or demo with missing events (not related to CSGO Demo Manager in this case).

### Demos date are wrong [#](/docs/analyze#wrong-date)

The date corresponds to the creation date of the demo file (.dem). For Valve (Matchmaking) demos, it use the demo info file (.info) to detect the real date of the match. If the date is wrong and it's a Valve demo, it's because the .info file is missing. If you renamed a Valve demo file, you have to rename the .info too.
