### How does the application download my MM demos? [#](/docs/downloads#how)

CSGO Demo Manager uses [boiler-writter](https://github.com/akiver/boiler-writter), a custom version of [Boiler](https://bitbucket.org/ACB/boiler/). Thanks to _ACB_ for creating Boiler.

Boiler-writter retrieves the matches information from the Steam Game Coordinator, stores it into a file then the app uses it to download the demos and generate their `.info` files.

### I have an error "MSVCP140.dll and VCRUNTIME140.dll is missing from your computer" [#](/docs/downloads#msvcp)

### My Steam status is "ingame" when I click on download? [#](/docs/downloads#steam-status)

To be able to retrieve matches information, Steam must be running and connected to a Steam account. You appear as playing CSGO during some seconds because it's required to communicate with the Steam GC. If CSGO was running it will be closed automatically.

### I don't have notifications to download newest demos? [#](/docs/downloads#notifications)

The BOT must be running, not necessarily the main application.

You can choose to start automatically the BOT when you launch CSGO Demo Manager from `Settings`.

## <p class="has-text-warning">The BOT has an option to start automatically at Windows startup.</p>

### I can only see my last 8 games? [#](/docs/downloads#matches-number)

At the moment only your last 8 games are available, this is the same behavior as in-game.

The app download it only if:

- The `.dem` and `.info` files are not in the download folder set from `Settings`.
- The demo's link is still available (Demos are deleted around 1 month after the match)
