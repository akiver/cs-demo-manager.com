A new feature to generate uncompressed or compressed videos from demos has been added.

- Uncompressed videos:
  - Great for video editing
  - Encoded with VirtualDub (using the built-in avi uncompressed codec)
  - No options, it just automatically import the tga, import the audio, set the framerate and save it as an AVI file.
- Compressed videos:
  - Not really recommended for video editing, it's more for "ready to watch" videos
  - Encoded with FFmpeg (codec x264)
  - There are some options to change the quality (video / audio)
