:::

### New features and improvements

#### 2D Viewer

- You can now play an audio file in the 2D viewer during playback. See the [documentation](/docs/guides/2d-viewer) for usage instructions.

#### Matches

- A filter to export voices of only specific players is available in the export context-menu.

#### Match

- Added melee weapons (knife, taser) stats in the weapons tab.

#### Settings

- Added a playback option to use older internal [CS2 'plugin'](/docs/guides/playback#cs2-plugin-compatibility). This allows to watch old demos not supported by the last CS2 build in combination of using an older CS2 Steam beta branch.
- Non-existent demos folders are now preserved on app startup.

#### Download

- The date of the match when downloading non-Valve demos is now more accurate. We retrieve it from the third-party service.

#### Video

- Added a player filter in the **'Generate players' sequence'** dialog to generate sequences for multiple players.
- Added a round filter in the **'Generate players' sequence'** dialog to generate sequences only for specific rounds.
- Added an option to preserve existing sequences in the **'Generate players' sequence'** dialog.
- Options requiring HLAE are hidden if the recording system is not HLAE.
- The app now uses the HLAE command `mirv_replace_name` (added in version 2.184.0) to replace player names.

### Fixes

#### General

- Support for the 28th July 2025 CS2 update.

#### 2D Viewer

- Flashbang icons in the players overview now match the number of flashbangs a player has.

#### Video

- Last player not visible in the table from the section 'Override player options' of the **'Edit sequences settings'** dialog.
- Possible single frame in the video when using HLAE with 128 tickrate **CS:GO** demos.

## v3.13.0

### New features and improvements

#### Maps

- Support for the new maps added in the May 9, 2025 CS2 update.

#### Demos/Matches

- Added an export mode selection dialog when exporting players' voices. You can now choose between:

  - One file per player (no silence, only voice)
  - One file per player (with silence, demo length)
  - Single file (all players voices are mixed together in one audio file, with silence, demo length)

#### Team

- Added a "**Performance**" tab in the team page that shows side, bomb, and round outcomes stats.

#### Analyze

- Added support for [Esplay](https://esplay.com) demos.

#### Search

- Added a "**Through smoke kills**" event to find kills made through smoke.

#### Players

- Added a context menu item and a button to export players to XLSX from the list/player's page.

#### Playback

- Counter-Strike launch parameters defined in the playback settings are now passed to the game when using HLAE through its `-customLaunchOptions` parameter.
- Added HLAE command-line parameters input in the app video settings. It's passed to HLAE when watching a demo.

#### Demos

- Added back the context menu item to export players voices from the list.

#### Video

- It's now possible to add multiple sequences with the same start/end ticks.

#### Match

- Added a "**Round outcomes by economy type**" chart in the "**Economy**" tab.

#### 2D viewer

## v3.12.0

### New features and improvements

#### UI

- Added a changelog that will be displayed when the app has been updated.  
  You can also access it from the settings in the "About" tab.
- Comment columns are now sortable, and the comment is displayed in a tooltip when the icon is hovered over.
- Updated de_cache radar and thumbnail images.

#### ANALYZE

- Added support for [Renown](https://renown.gg/) demos.

#### PLAYBACK

- Added CS2 aliases that you can type into the game's console or bind it to a keyboard key to listen to specific team/player's voices when watching an analyzed demo from the app.  
  The following aliases are available:

  - <code>voice_all</code>: listen to all players
  - <code>voice_ct</code>: listen to players that **STARTED** as CT
  - <code>voice_t</code>: listen to players that **STARTED** as T
  - <code>voice_STEAMID64</code>: listen to a specific player. Replace <code>STEAMID64</code> by the player's SteamID64.
    Example: <code>voice_76561198000697560</code>.

  **It's important to note that for teams aliases it's the starting side, not the current one!**

#### VIDEO

- It's now possible to generate videos using the HLAE sampling system that "streams" the game frames directly to FFmpeg.  
  It means that you don't need a lot of disk space as images are not saved on the disk anymore and the generation is faster.  
  Please see the updated [documentation](/docs/guides/video) for details.  
  **This feature requires HLAE so it's available only on Windows!**
- Added an option to select the "recording system". **Counter-Strike** (<code>startmovie</code> command) or HLAE (<code>mirv_streams</code> command).
- Added an option to select the output format (**Images**, **Images + video**, or **Video**).  
  It also means that the checkboxes "Generate only raw files" and "Delete raw files after encoding" are gone.
- Removed the option to define the folder where raw files are saved.  
  It's now directly saved in the output folder when using HLAE or moved to the output folder otherwise.  
  It didn't really make sens because the raw files were actually saved on the disk where CS is installed and then moved (the <code>startmovie</code> command doesn't allow to define the output).
- Allow to set seconds before/after each kill/round to start/stop sequences through a dialog.
- Added a checkbox "Show only death notices" in sequences edition dialog.
- Added checkboxes in the players table to enable/disable players' voices.
- It's now possible to change the death notices duration per sequence.
- Default recording settings are now configurable from the app settings.
- It's now possible to install FFmpeg without installing HLAE first on Windows.

#### MATCH

- Added search input in chat tab to filter messages.

#### MATCHES

- Added context-menu item to export chat messages.

#### SEARCH

- Added no scope kills event.

#### PLAYER

- Added utilities and opening duels stats panel.
- Added "Export players voice" in matches table context-menu.

#### DOWNLOAD

- Added support for downloading demos from 5EPlay.
- Improved error message when retrieving last MM matches while your Steam account is in-game on another device.

#### DEMOS

- Added a UI option to redirect to the match page (instead of the demo page) when opening an analyzed demo. It's disabled by default.

### Fixes

#### ANALYZE

**Requires re-analyzing demos!**

- Incorrect trade kill/death detection.
- Missing chat messages.

#### MATCH

- Possible wrong duels matrix values.

#### VIDEO

- New FFmpeg major/minor version not detected on Windows.

## v3.1.0

- feat(match): add a "**Duels**" tab with opening duels stats and an interactive map to find out where opening kills
  happened
- feat: add support for [FASTCUP](https://fastcup.net/) demos
- feat: add support for exporting players' voices from CS2 demos (it was possible only for CSGO demos).
  Thanks to [DandrewsDev](https://github.com/DandrewsDev) for his open-source [project](https://github.com/DandrewsDev/CS2VoiceData).
  :::danger  
   Valve Matchmaking demos (CS2 and CSGO) do not contain voice audio data hence there is nothing to extract from MM demos.  
   You can extract voices only from demos recorded from a server that includes voice data.
  :::
- feat: add "**Export players voice**" in the matches table context menu (it was possible only from the demos table).  
  It requires the `.dem` file on your filesystem otherwise you will have a "**Demo not found**" warning.
- feat: the application should now receive fewer rate limit errors from the Steam API, but using
  [your own Steam API key](/docs/guides/settings#using-a-custom-steam-api-key) is still recommended.
- feat(demos): add a checkbox to include subfolders for the current folder from the demos table
- feat(demo): avoid doing calls to the Steam API if possible when going to a demo page
- feat(video): turn off spellcheck in CFG input
- feat(ui): improve filtering menu layout
