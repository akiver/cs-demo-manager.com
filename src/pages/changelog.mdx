#### UI

- Added a changelog that will be displayed when the app has been updated.  
  You can also access it from the settings in the "About" tab.
- Comment columns are now sortable, and the comment is displayed in a tooltip when the icon is hovered over.
- Updated de_cache radar and thumbnail images.

#### ANALYZE

- Added support for [Renown](https://renown.gg/) demos.

#### PLAYBACK

- Added CS2 aliases that you can type into the game's console or bind it to a keyboard key to listen to specific team/player's voices when watching an analyzed demo from the app.  
  The following aliases are available:
  - `voice_all`: listen to all players
  - `voice_ct`: listen to players that **STARTED** as CT
  - `voice_t`: listen to players that **STARTED** as T
  - `voice_STEAMID64`: listen to a specific player. Replace `STEAMID64` by the player's SteamID64.
    Example: `voice_76561198000697560`.

  **It's important to note that for teams aliases it's the starting side, not the current one!**

#### VIDEO

- It's now possible to generate videos using the HLAE sampling system that "streams" the game frames directly to FFmpeg.  
  It means that you don't need a lot of disk space as images are not saved on the disk anymore and the generation is faster.  
  Please see the updated [documentation](/docs/guides/video) for details.  
  **This feature requires HLAE so it's available only on Windows!**
- Added an option to select the "recording system". **Counter-Strike** (`startmovie` command) or HLAE (`mirv_streams` command).
- Added an option to select the output format (**Images**, **Images + video**, or **Video**).  
  It also means that the checkboxes "Generate only raw files" and "Delete raw files after encoding" are gone.
- Removed the option to define the folder where raw files are saved.  
  It's now directly saved in the output folder when using HLAE or moved to the output folder otherwise.  
  It didn't really make sens because the raw files were actually saved on the disk where CS is installed and then moved (the `startmovie` command doesn't allow to define the output).
- Allow to set seconds before/after each kill/round to start/stop sequences through a dialog.
- Added a checkbox "Show only death notices" in sequences edition dialog.
- Added checkboxes in the players table to enable/disable players' voices.
- It's now possible to change the death notices duration per sequence.
- Default recording settings are now configurable from the app settings.
- It's now possible to install FFmpeg without installing HLAE first on Windows.

#### MATCH

- Added search input in chat tab to filter messages.

#### MATCHES

- Added context-menu item to export chat messages.

#### SEARCH

- Added no scope kills event.

#### PLAYER

- Added utilities and opening duels stats panel.
- Added "Export players voice" in matches table context-menu.

#### DOWNLOAD

- Added support for downloading demos from 5EPlay.
- Improved error message when retrieving last MM matches while your Steam account is in-game on another device.

#### DEMOS

- Added a UI option to redirect to the match page (instead of the demo page) when opening an analyzed demo. It's disabled by default.

### Fixes

#### ANALYZE

**Requires re-analyzing demos!**

- Incorrect trade kill/death detection.
- Missing chat messages.

#### MATCH

- Possible wrong duels matrix values.

#### VIDEO

- New FFmpeg major/minor version not detected on Windows.

   Please understand that it's not an easy task and it may take time.
  :::

- fix: CS2 executable may not be found on Linux since the last CS2 major update
- feat: the configuration folder location now follows the XDG Base Directory Specification on Linux

  happened

   You can extract voices only from demos recorded from a server that includes voice data.

  [your own Steam API key](/docs/guides/settings#using-a-custom-steam-api-key) is still recommended.
